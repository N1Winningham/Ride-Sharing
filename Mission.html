            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>Our mission is to connect potential student drivers to students on campus and monetize the value from their own cars. Our platform is designed to cater to your needs of ride sharing particularly in an environment where ride services are extremely difficult to access due to its location and high rental fees from monopoly car rental businesses in the area. Book your rides with us to ensure fast, reliable and premium ride services with pick up at your door to your desired location across Wooster and beyond. Drivers looking to make a quick out of your own cars too can sign up with our platform and be matched with potential riders.</p>
